README for NST-part code:

Please open the NST.ipynb in Colab, and take a look at the code (including both image NST and video NST) as well as the visualization results.

Our code includes the implementation of the traditional Neural Style Transfer (NST) algorithm [1] over multiple images as well as its consistency-based version for video style transfer.

For more visualization results, please refer to the Final Project Report.
