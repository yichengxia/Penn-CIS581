# Exploring Image Style Transfer: From Neural Style Transfer to CycleGAN

In this project, we implement two deep learning based methods for image style transfer.

We start
from using Neural Style Transfer (NST) to blend styles and contents from any two images and extend
its use on video style transfer by enforcing consistency constraints. We then implement CycleGAN for
unpaired image and video style transfer and conduct extensive test on the designs of the model to explore
more characteristics of this method.

We have promising results in both image and video generating and
in both NST and CycleGAN.
